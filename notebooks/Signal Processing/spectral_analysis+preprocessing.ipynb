    "\n",
    "In the digital world, we have neither continuous nor periodic signals. We always work with sampled signals. Therefore, we need to define some terms characterising the sampling:   \n",
    "* The *sampling interval* is the temporal distance $\\Delta t$ between the single sample values. The position on the time axis of one sample $k$ of the signal is thus given as $t = k\\Delta t$ with $k=[1,2, ..., N]$ and $N$ being the maximum number of samples within the signal.  \n",
    "* The *period* of the signal is then given as $T = N\\Delta t$.\n",
    "* The *sampling rate* - also called the *sampling frequency* - is $\\Delta f = 1/T$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The *sampling theorem* states that at least 2 samples per period are needed to correctly reproduce the highest frequency of a signal. Or in other words: A signal can only reproduced properly when it does not contain frequency components above one-half of the sampling frequency. This is the definition of the *Nyquist frequency*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{Ny} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consequence of this theorem is the necessity to low-pass data *before* resampling them to a lower sample rate. The corner frequency of the low-pass filter is maximum the Nyquist frequency of the *new* sample rate. If this necessity is not considered, we obtain *aliasing* effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with spectral analysis, it should be clear that it is fundamentally based on the characterisitics and properties of the *[Fourier series/Fourier transformation](fourier_transform.ipynb)*. Make sure, that you have understood this lecture as well. \n",
